# Defining services

An extremely simple way to call the skupper_service role, providing just
the list of **_services_** to be defined against a specific site.

The playbook used here, expects that the **_sample_** namespace already
exists and has a running skupper site.

As the intention is simply to demonstrate how a list of services can
be maintained through skupper-ansible.
