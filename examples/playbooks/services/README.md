# Defining services

This is just an extremely simple way to call the skupper_service role,
passing just list of **_services_** to de defined against a specific site.

The playbook used here, expects that the **_sample_** namespace already
exists and has a running skupper site.

As the intention is simply to demonstrate how a list of services can
be maintained through skupper-ansible.
